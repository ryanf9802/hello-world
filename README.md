# hello-world
My first repository ( I still have no clue what that word means )

Hey people. My name is Ryan Fitzpatrick and I'm a senior at Marriott's Ridge High School. 
I took Computer Science Principles AP last year, and I'm taking Principles of Java Programming GT right now.
I'm very interested in coding and plan to base my career around coding in the future.
